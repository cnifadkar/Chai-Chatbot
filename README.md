# Chatbot with PyTorch

This project presents a straightforward implementation of a contextual chatbot using PyTorch, designed to be accessible for all. The chatbot is built on a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers, demonstrating the core principles of chatbot development.

## Key Features

- **Simplicity**: The codebase is kept simple and readable.
- **Customizability**: Users can easily adapt the chatbot for various use cases by modifying the `intents.json` file, which defines the bot's responses and patterns.
- **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: Employs a neural network architecture with two hidden layers to process and respond to user inputs.
